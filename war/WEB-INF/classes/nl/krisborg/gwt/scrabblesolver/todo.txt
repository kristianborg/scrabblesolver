- consider bigger wordlist; current one contains only upto 10-char words
- incorporate grammer-bugfix
- add feedback of computation-status
- improve algorithm; it's going to be sloooooooooooow
- add compression to wordlist
- check firefox error console; some css errors

nice to have:
- make board and tiles fully css-drawn
